					<h2>Combine with other formats</h2>
					<blockquote>
					<p><strong>Intro:</strong> <em>This is a relevant scenario for list generation using utilizing Wikidata since data needs to be complete (at least for a given usecase) to generate a good list from it. Though this is part of creating lists, it happens only on Wikidata and the list creation itself is not part ot this.</em></p>
					<p><strong>Example scenario:</strong> John notices that his hometown does not have a mayor listed on the hometown’s item. He wants to see which other towns and cities also lack this property and wonders if he could fix it, at least for the places in his county.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Example quote:</strong> “I could quickly find out what I wanted to know and correct the data”
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Workflow we assume:</strong>
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>You “Request a query” or write a query yourself to find to find all places which are municipalities but lack a mayor</li>
						<li>You find out who the current mayor of every (or some) places is</li>
						<li>You add that person’s item to the property “head of government” of the city’s item</li>
						<li>If no item for the major exists, you create the item.</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>What makes them suitable as a tool?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Intuitive</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Robust</strong></li>

						In addition, for open source projects in particular

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Text based</strong></li>
